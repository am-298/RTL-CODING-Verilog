This repository is a collection of well-documented and tested RTL modules that aim to:
- Provide learning material for those interested in digital logic design and Verilog/SystemVerilog programming.
- Serve as a reference for common hardware design patterns like multiplexers, flip-flops, counters, memory units, and arithmetic units.
- Offer reusable and customizable code that can be used as building blocks for more complex digital systems.

## Key Learning Areas

The projects here focus on a variety of essential concepts in digital logic, including:
- **Combinational and Sequential Logic**: Modules that illustrate both types of logic, such as counters, shift registers, and multiplexers.
- **Memory Structures**: Examples of various memory models, including dual-port RAM and SRAM.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Demonstrations of basic operations like addition and parity generation.
- **Clocking and Reset Design**: Projects that cover clock generation, reset handling, and synchronization.

## Tools and Technologies

These projects use Verilog and SystemVerilog as the hardware description languages. To simulate and verify the modules, the following tools can be used:
- **EDA Playground**
- **Vivado**
